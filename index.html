        <p>1. The Earth's core is as hot as the surface of the sun, reaching temperatures of up to 6000°C. Despite this, the Earth's crust remains cool and protects us from the intense heat.</p>
        
        <p>2. About 70% of the Earth's surface is covered in water, yet only about 1% of that water is drinkable. This makes fresh water one of the most precious resources on Earth.</p>
        
        <p>3. Earth has an incredibly powerful magnetic field, which acts as a shield against harmful cosmic radiation and solar winds. Without it, life on Earth would be impossible.</p>
