Putting It All Together
This project is a practical implementation of key front-end development concepts, integrating form validation, dynamic UI updates, and user feedback mechanisms. It demonstrates:

Input field styling changes based on user interaction.
Real-time validation for user inputs.
Popup confirmation messages on successful submission.
It serves as a showcase of clean and functional front-end design practices.
